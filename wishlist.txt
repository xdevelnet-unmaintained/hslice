I. More tests:

1) Module-independent tests -- already done?
2) Test-scenario descriptions -- not always needed. When scenario is not obvios, commend already present
3) Undefined behavior tests
4) Separated valgrind checking with TRAVIS-CI
5) Test order should be correct -- already done?

II. Functional

1) Library real functional should correspond declared functional in documentation
2) Shared object compiling options
3) Shared object interface options
4) Add examples
5) Implement length feature

III. Important, but not technical

1) Update README.md with detailed description
2) Update documentation examples. They are probably UNCORRECT
3) Test it in real... and cruel world. Probably with FASTCGI application
4) Tell about this library to someone
5( Feel shame
